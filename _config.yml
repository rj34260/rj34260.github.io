  Hi, my name's Rachel and I'm a senior in high school. I strive to help animals in shelters and build an animal sanctuary one day. I love sports of any kind but basketball and track have a special place in my heart. I love learning and am a fast learner.
  

  I am most skilled in: Basic tech and training dogs

                I've done a couple of projects over the past 5 years. When I was around 13-14 I helped a family build their entertainment system including their entertainment stand. After I built the stand I hooked up their two TVs and connected their devices to their wifi. Everyone thought setting up that system was difficult but it seemed like second nature to me. I've done a couple of projects at the non-profit camp. We installed turf into this sloppy hill, cleared tree debris from their streets, built a volleyball pit, and did a little landscaping from time to time. I've also applied to help volunteer at an animal shelter.

            Looking for opportunities to help the people and animals in my community

           I enjoy helping all around. No matter if that's kids, teens, adults, or animals. I love building/creating things. If we all help each other our communities will get stronger and strive.
